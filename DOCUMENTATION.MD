## 1. Introduction

The ARANYANI Mark 1 is a proudly "Made in Bharat" robot developed by Shourya Maker Lab. It incorporates fundamental robotic movements and is designed to accept PWM signals from a remote controller (FS-T6) for controlling motor drivers (MD 10C by Cytron) and a relay module.

### Purpose and Goals

This documentation aims to provide users with all the necessary information to understand, assemble, configure, and operate the ARANYANI Mark 1 robot. Whether you are an enthusiast, a student, or a researcher, this documentation will guide you through the setup and usage of the robot.
